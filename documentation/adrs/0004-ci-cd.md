# 4. CI/CD with GitHub Actions

Date: 2024-11-19

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We require a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) solution to automate building, testing, and deploying our applications. The options considered were **GitHub Actions** and **Jenkins**. Key factors influencing this decision include:

- **Integration with Existing Tools**: Our codebase and project management are already hosted on GitHub.
- **Ease of Use and Maintenance**: Minimizing the setup and maintenance overhead associated with the CI/CD infrastructure.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Optimizing costs by leveraging existing platforms without additional infrastructure expenses.
- **Team Familiarity**: Utilizing tools that the team is already comfortable with to reduce the learning curve.
- **Scaling and Flexibility**: Ability to scale workflows and integrate with a variety of services and platforms.

## Decision

We have decided to adopt **GitHub Actions** as our CI/CD platform. This choice is driven by the seamless integration it offers with our existing GitHub repositories, simplifying our development workflows and reducing the complexity of managing separate CI/CD systems.

## Consequences

**Positive Outcomes:**

- **Seamless Integration:**
  - **Unified Platform:** GitHub Actions is natively integrated with GitHub, allowing us to manage code and CI/CD workflows in a single interface.
  - **Simplified Authentication:** No need to configure additional authentication mechanisms between the code repository and the CI/CD system.
  - **Trigger Workflows Effortlessly:** Workflows can be triggered on various GitHub events such as pushes, pull requests, and issues.

- **Ease of Use and Maintenance:**
  - **Reduced Overhead:** Eliminates the need to install, configure, and maintain a separate CI/CD server like Jenkins.
  - **Quick Setup:** Developers can quickly write workflows using YAML files stored in the repository.
  - **Scalability:** GitHub Actions scales automatically, handling our workload without manual intervention.

- **Cost Efficiency:**
  - **Included Usage:** GitHub Actions includes a set amount of free minutes and storage, reducing additional costs.
  - **No Infrastructure Costs:** Removes the need for dedicated servers or cloud instances to run CI/CD pipelines.
  - **Pay-as-You-Go Model:** We only pay for what we use beyond the included resources.

- **Enhanced Collaboration:**
  - **Code Reviews and CI/CD Integration:** Pull requests can show CI/CD status checks directly, improving code review quality.
  - **Visibility:** All team members can view and access workflow runs and logs.

- **Flexibility and Extensibility:**
  - **Marketplace Actions:** Access to a wide range of pre-built actions in the GitHub Marketplace to extend functionality.
  - **Custom Actions:** Ability to create custom actions tailored to our specific needs.

**Potential Drawbacks:**

- **Vendor Lock-In:**
  - **Dependency on GitHub:** Our CI/CD processes become tightly coupled with GitHub, potentially complicating future migrations.
  - **Proprietary Configuration:** Workflows are defined using GitHub-specific syntax, which may not be directly transferable to other platforms.

- **Limitations Compared to Jenkins:**
  - **Advanced Customizations:** Jenkins offers extensive plugins and customization options that may not be available in GitHub Actions.
  - **Complex Workflows:** For highly complex CI/CD pipelines, Jenkins might provide more flexibility.

- **Resource Limits:**
  - **Usage Caps:** GitHub Actions comes with usage limits which, if exceeded, could lead to additional costs or throttling.
  - **Self-Hosted Runners Requirement:** For certain build environments, we might need to set up self-hosted runners, adding some maintenance overhead.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- **Modular Workflow Design:**
  - **Reusable Components:** Write workflows in a modular fashion to facilitate reuse and potential migration.
  - **Avoid Over-Customization:** Stick to standard practices to minimize dependencies on GitHub-specific features.

- **Monitoring and Optimization:**
  - **Usage Tracking:** Regularly monitor our usage of GitHub Actions to stay within budget and resource limits.
  - **Optimize Workflows:** Continuously refine workflows to be efficient and cost-effective.

- **Contingency Planning:**
  - **Documentation:** Maintain thorough documentation of our CI/CD configurations.
  - **Evaluate Alternatives Periodically:** Keep abreast of developments in other CI/CD tools in case a future shift is necessary.

By choosing GitHub Actions, we leverage our existing investment in GitHub, simplify our development processes, and reduce operational overhead. While there is potential for vendor lock-in and some limitations compared to Jenkins, the benefits of integration, ease of use, and cost savings align well with our current organizational needs.

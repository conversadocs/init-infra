# 2. AWS

Date: 2024-11-19

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to select a cloud provider to host our applications and services. The options considered are Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The primary factors influencing this decision include:

- **Engineering Familiarity:** Our engineering team has significant experience with AWS. This includes in-depth knowledge of AWS services such as EC2, S3, EKS, ECS, ECR, DynamoDB, RDS (Aurora), IAM, Lambda, API Gateway, and associated tools.

- **Time to Market:** Leveraging a platform that the team is already proficient in will accelerate development and deployment, reducing the time to market for our products.

- **Ecosystem and Community Support:** AWS has a vast ecosystem with extensive community support, documentation, and third-party integrations that can enhance productivity and problem-solving.

- **Feature Set Alignment:** AWS offers a comprehensive suite of services that align closely with our technical requirements, including container orchestration, serverless computing, managed databases, and more.

- **Scalability and Reliability:** AWS provides proven scalability and reliability, essential for supporting our application's growth and ensuring high availability.

## Decision

We have decided to adopt **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** as our primary cloud provider for hosting and managing our infrastructure and applications. This decision is primarily based on the team's existing familiarity with AWS, which is expected to streamline development processes and reduce onboarding time.

## Consequences

**Positive Outcomes:**

- **Accelerated Development:**
  - The team's expertise with AWS will facilitate faster development cycles.
  - Reduced learning curve compared to adopting a new platform.

- **Operational Efficiency:**
  - Familiarity with AWS best practices will improve deployment and operational procedures.
  - Easier troubleshooting and management due to prior experience.

- **Cost Efficiency in Onboarding:**
  - Lower training costs since the team does not require extensive training to use AWS services.

- **Rich Feature Set:**
  - Access to a wide range of AWS services that meet our current and future needs.

**Potential Drawbacks:**

- **Vendor Lock-In:**
  - Increased dependency on AWS may make future migration to other platforms more challenging.
  - Proprietary services may not have direct equivalents in other cloud providers.

- **Cost Management:**
  - AWS services can become expensive if not monitored and managed effectively.
  - Requires diligent cost optimization strategies to control expenses.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- **Modular Architecture Design:**
  - Build the application using modular and cloud-agnostic design principles where feasible to reduce tight coupling with AWS-specific services.

- **Regular Evaluation:**
  - Periodically assess cloud provider offerings to ensure AWS continues to meet our needs effectively compared to competitors.

- **Cost Monitoring Tools:**
  - Implement AWS cost management tools and practices to monitor resource usage and optimize spending.

- **Knowledge Sharing:**
  - Encourage continuous learning and knowledge sharing within the team to stay updated on AWS services and best practices.

By choosing AWS, we leverage our team's strengths to deliver high-quality products efficiently while acknowledging and planning for potential risks associated with this decision.

# 3. AWS Organization Structure with Multiple Accounts

Date: 2024-11-19

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Our organization requires a cloud infrastructure setup that supports development, testing, and production environments while ensuring strong security, isolation, and governance. We are considering how to structure our AWS accounts to best meet these needs.

Key considerations include:

- **Environment Isolation**: Preventing unintended interactions between environments (e.g., development code affecting production data).
- **Security and Compliance**: Implementing policies that enforce security best practices and compliance requirements across all environments.
- **Cost Management**: Ability to track and manage costs associated with different environments and teams.
- **Scalability and Management**: Facilitating growth and efficient management as the organization expands.

## Decision

We have decided to adopt an **AWS Organization** structure utilizing multiple AWS accounts organized under a single management account, referred to as the **Prime** account. The accounts will be set up as follows:

- **Prime Account**: The management account that oversees the AWS Organization. It is used for consolidated billing, centralized management, and governance.
- **Development (DEV) Account**: Dedicated to development activities, allowing developers to build and test new features without impacting other environments.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Account**: Used for user acceptance testing to validate new features and changes before they are moved to production.
- **Implementation (IMPL) Account**: Serves as a staging environment where final preparations and deployments occur before going live.
- **Production (PROD) Account**: Hosts live applications and services accessed by end-users.

Additionally, we will utilize Organizational Units (OUs) and Service Control Policies (SCPs) to enforce policies and manage permissions across accounts.

## Consequences

**Positive Outcomes:**

- **Enhanced Security and Isolation:**
  - **Environment Separation:** Each account is isolated, reducing the risk of cross-environment contamination or accidental interference.
  - **Granular Access Control:** Policies and permissions can be tailored to each account, enhancing security.
  - **Blast Radius Reduction:** Security incidents are contained within individual accounts, minimizing impact.

- **Improved Governance and Compliance:**
  - **Centralized Management:** The Prime account allows for centralized billing, auditing, and policy enforcement.
  - **Policy Enforcement with SCPs:** SCPs ensure that all accounts comply with organizational security standards and best practices.

- **Cost Visibility and Management:**
  - **Separate Billing:** Costs can be tracked per account, making it easier to monitor and optimize spending for each environment.
  - **Budgeting and Alerting:** Set budgets and alerts for each account to prevent unexpected expenses.

- **Scalability and Flexibility:**
  - **Easier Management of Teams:** Different teams can be granted access to specific accounts based on their roles.
  - **Future Growth:** Additional accounts can be added under the AWS Organization as needed.

- **Operational Efficiency:**
  - **Automated Account Provisioning:** Using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform to manage accounts and resources promotes consistency and repeatability.
  - **Simplified Resource Management:** Resources are organized per environment, simplifying navigation and management.

**Potential Drawbacks:**

- **Increased Complexity:**
  - **Management Overhead:** Managing multiple accounts adds complexity in terms of administration and maintenance.
  - **Initial Setup Effort:** Setting up the organization and configuring cross-account access requires careful planning and execution.

- **Cross-Account Access Challenges:**
  - **Resource Sharing:** Sharing resources between accounts (if needed) requires additional configuration (e.g., IAM roles, VPC peering).
  - **Operational Coordination:** Deployments that span multiple accounts may require more coordination.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- **Automation and Tooling:**
  - **Use Terraform and AWS Organizations APIs:** Automate the creation and management of accounts, OUs, and policies to reduce manual effort.
  - **Implement CI/CD Pipelines:** Streamline deployments and ensure consistency across environments.

- **Standardized Practices:**
  - **Define Clear Policies and Procedures:** Establish guidelines for account usage, access management, and resource provisioning.
  - **Documentation and Training:** Provide thorough documentation and training to teams on managing and operating within their respective accounts.

- **Efficient Cross-Account Networking:**
  - **Centralized Networking Services:** Configure AWS Transit Gateway or VPC peering for necessary network communications between accounts.
  - **Shared Services Account (if needed):** Consider creating a shared services account for common resources used across environments.

- **Monitoring and Logging:**
  - **Centralize Logs and Metrics:** Use services like AWS CloudTrail and CloudWatch to collect and monitor logs and metrics from all accounts.
  - **Security Auditing:** Regularly audit account configurations and permissions to ensure compliance.

By adopting this AWS Organization approach with multiple accounts for different environments, we enhance our security posture, improve governance, and position ourselves for scalable growth. While there is added complexity, the benefits of isolation, control, and flexibility outweigh the challenges, which can be mitigated through automation, standardized practices, and effective management strategies.

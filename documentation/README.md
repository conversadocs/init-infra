## Overview

ConversaDocs requires a robust and secure cloud infrastructure to support its suite of applications and services. The primary business need is to create an AWS environment that enables developers to build, test, and deploy applications efficiently while ensuring strong security and compliance across all stages of the development lifecycle.

To achieve this, we plan to implement an AWS Organization structure utilizing multiple AWS accounts organized under a central Prime (management) account. The accounts will be segmented into the following environments:

- **Development (DEV) Account**: For development activities, allowing developers to experiment and innovate without affecting other environments.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Account**: To validate new features and fixes in an environment that simulates production before release.
- **Implementation (IMPL) Account**: Serves as the staging area for final testing and preparation before deployment to production.
- **Production (PROD) Account**: Holds the live applications and services accessed by end-users, requiring the highest level of security and stability. 

This multi-account strategy aims to:

- **Enhance Security and Isolation**: By isolating environments at the account level, we reduce the risk of cross-environment interference and improve our security posture.
- **Simplify Governance and Compliance**: Utilize Service Control Policies (SCPs) and Organizational Units (OUs) to enforce policies and compliance requirements centrally.
- **Improve Scalability and Management**: Facilitate easier management of resources and teams, and allow the infrastructure to scale with organizational growth.
- **Optimize Cost Management**: Enable detailed cost tracking and optimization for each environment to control expenses effectively. 

The implementation will leverage Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform to automate the provisioning and management of AWS resources, ensuring consistency and repeatability across all environments.

**Summary**

The MVP delivers the foundational AWS infrastructure necessary to support our development and production environments. By automating the creation of the AWS Organization, accounts, and critical infrastructure components using Terraform, and integrating CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, we achieve:

- **Environment Isolation**: Separate DEV and PROD accounts to prevent cross-environment impacts.
- **Governance and Compliance**: Enforce organizational policies through SCPs.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Streamlined deployment processes using Infrastructure as Code and automated pipelines.
- **Scalability**: Establish a scalable framework that can be extended to include additional environments or services as needed.

This setup provides the minimum required features to launch our services to production while ensuring security, compliance, and efficiency.

## Non-Goals

This infrastructure setup will **not** include the following:

- **Application-Level Infrastructure**: It will not provision or configure the infrastructure required to run our core product or any other application-specific services. The focus is solely on establishing the foundational AWS accounts and organizational structure.

- **Employee Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: It will not manage IAM users, roles, or policies related to employee accounts. Setting up and managing individual user permissions and access controls within each AWS account is outside the scope of this project.

- **GitHub Repository and User Management**: It will not manage GitHub repositories, user accounts, or permissions. While GitHub Actions is utilized for CI/CD pipelines, the creation and administration of GitHub resources and user access are not handled by this infrastructure setup.

- **Deployment of Applications and Services**: It will not handle the deployment of application code, container images, or serverless functions to the AWS environment. Application deployment processes will be addressed separately.

- **Operational Tooling and Monitoring Setup**: It will not set up operational tools, monitoring systems, logging frameworks, or alerting mechanisms beyond what is necessary for the AWS Organization and CI/CD pipeline foundation.

- **Network Connectivity Between Accounts**: While the initial VPCs may be created, configuring network connectivity (e.g., VPC peering, Transit Gateway) between AWS accounts is not included.

- **Data Migration or Management**: It will not include any data migration tasks or the management of data storage solutions beyond the foundational setup.

- **Security Compliance Audits**: Although security best practices are applied, conducting formal security compliance audits (e.g., SOC 2, HIPAA) is not within the scope.

- **Cost Optimization Efforts**: It will not perform detailed cost optimization or implement cost-saving measures beyond the initial setup. Ongoing cost management will be handled separately.

The primary goal of this project is to establish the foundational AWS Organization, accounts, and CI/CD pipelines to enable teams to begin development and deployment activities. Additional infrastructure components and services will be provisioned in subsequent phases or separate projects.
